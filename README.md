Title: Road Traffic Accident Severity Classification
Description: This data set is collected from Addis Ababa Sub-city police departments for master's research work. The data set has been prepared from manual records of road traffic accidents of the year 2017-20. It has 32 features and 12316 instances of the accident. Then it is preprocessed and for identification of major causes of the accident by analyzing it using different machine learning classification algorithms.
Overview: 
1.	Performed exploratory data analysis, resampling using SMOTE and Pre-processed data before classification.
2.	Built and trained model using machine learning algorithms.
3.	Analyzed model performance using classification accuracy and F1 score as evaluation metric.
4.	Web application was built to classify accident severity using streamlit and deployed on AWS.
Result: Achieved 92% classification accuracy using extra tree classifier on test dataset.
